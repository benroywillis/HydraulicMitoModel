Vcho: a "battery" 
 - Rglycolysis is the internal resistance specific to the carbohydrate battery
 - delivering energy through glycolysis, ETC and cvant resistors (these are the internal resistances of the battery)

Vfat: a "battery" 
 - beta ox is the internal resistance specific to the fat battery

Rglyc: the internal resistance of the Vcho resistance
 - equation:

Roxphos: shorthand for writing (ETC+CVant) together
 - it is common to the two fuels

RCVant: variable with Vatp (the atp water level)
 - 

Rbox is constant

Retc is constant

Cpcr: the capacitance of the system
 - models the entire system capacitance because the rest of capacitances are negligibly large

Rmotor: this is the load resistor connected to the battery(ies)
 - models any reaction that requires ATP
 - example: contractile proteins
